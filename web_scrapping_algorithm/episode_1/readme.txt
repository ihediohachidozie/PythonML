Write a python algorithm that finds websites with format
https://12693.portal.athenahealth.com/ and runs through the different variations of that and 
then pulls the practice name on the site into excel file.

Every site has the same format "welcome to the _____ patient portal" so we would just need
the algorithm to run through all the different available number variations of the URL format
and then pull the URL and the _____ from the "Welcome to the _____ patient portal" part of the
site into an excel file.
